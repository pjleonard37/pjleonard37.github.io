My Master's thesis explores the relationship between changing social demographics, ethno-religious segregation, and interpersonal violence during The Troubles conflict (1960-1998). This project was awarded the <a href="https://cir.uchicago.edu/content/kaplan-prize">Morton A. Kaplan Prize</a> for best Honors thesis. Please contact me for a copy of the thesis.
